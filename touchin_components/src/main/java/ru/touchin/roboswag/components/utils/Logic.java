/**
 * Created by Gavriil Sitnikov on 24/03/16.
 * Base class representing application's logic.
 * In specific application it should be child of it (usually one) which contains all methods/objects related to logic.
 * It should contains interface to work with API/preferences/database/file system/system parameters etc.
 * Be sure that all objects/instances/services created to represents logic are not getting a lot of time to be instantiated, if they take a lot time
 * for instantiation then it is wrong logic and it should be moved into asynchronous operations via {@link Observable} or so.
 * Also it shouldn't create massive data objects and a lot of objects instantly. Basically it should just create bunch of interfaces inside
 * which will allows to access to some logic methods.
 * In fact it is similar to dependency injection pattern but with full control of instantiation and only one single instance of {@link Logic} per app.
 * If you want to use it then just create getter in {@link android.app.Service}/{@link android.app.Activity}/{@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver}
 * or any else context-based elements and do not forget to store reference to {@link Logic} into field because else it will be consumed by GC.
 * Sample of {@link Logic} using is in {@link ru.touchin.roboswag.components.navigation.activities.ViewControllerActivity}.
 * NOTE: Ideally creation of logic should be asynchronous and stored in specific {@link android.app.Service} so it should be accessed
 * asynchronously via {@link Observable} or so. But in fact it requires {@link android.app.Service} plus more complex methods to access to logic.
 * So currently it is more simple to access via simple bridge based on singletons stored into {@link WeakReference} because anyway instantiation of
 * logic have to be as fast as it can. If it's not then it is just a bug and problem of optimization.
